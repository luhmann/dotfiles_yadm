# Jira Task Briefing

Read and analyze a Jira issue briefing for the provided issue ID. If no issue ID is provided try to infer it from the current branch name. It should have a format like DGAPP-XXXX.

!jira issue view $ARGUMENTS --plain

Please analyze the issue details above and provide:

1. A concise summary of the task
2. Key requirements and acceptance criteria
3. Any dependencies or blockers mentioned
4. Priority and timeline information
5. Technical considerations or constraints

Focus on actionable insights for implementation planning.

After your analysis, please ask me about any additional information you might need to better understand the task or provide more specific guidance, especially on ambiguous product requirements

Then create a branch with a descriptive name that also contains the issue ID.
