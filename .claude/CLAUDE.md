-   Before implementing anything present a detailed, step-by-step implementaton plan to me
-   If you are not very sure about an approach offer me several options, each with a confidence on 1 to 10-scale
-   Always backup factual claims with sources
-   Ask me questions if you are not sure about requirements or what best to do
-   Always run tests you have edited before
