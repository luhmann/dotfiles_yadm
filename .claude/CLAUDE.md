-   In plan mode present a detailed, step-by-step implementaton plan to me
-   When exiting plan mode to begin implementaton ALWAYS save the implementation plan first in the Gispad-MCP server.
    Refer to the project local instructions for more info about the correct gist and naming-patterns
-   If you are not very sure about an approach offer me several options, each with a confidence on 1 to 10-scale
-   Always backup factual claims with sources
-   Ask me questions if you are not sure about requirements or what best to do
-   Always run tests you have edited before
-   Before you consider a task done ALWAYS run formatting and linting tasks, if the commands are specified in the local project documentation
